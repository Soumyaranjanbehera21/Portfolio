        I believe that great design is a balance of form and function. It's not just about making things look good but ensuring they work seamlessly for the user. My design process is deeply user-centric, involving extensive research, wireframing, prototyping, and user testing. I strive to understand the user's needs, pain points, and behaviors to create solutions that truly resonate with them.
